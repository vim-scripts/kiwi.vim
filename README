`kiwi.vim` is a plugin for working with the [Kiwi](http://kiwi-lib.org/)
library for behavior-driven development.  Right now, it simply adds
smart folding, but I have some abbreviations which I'll add once I
hammer out some pretty ugly kinks.

Which Files Are Kiwi?
---------------------

To keep things simple, I just match anything that matches `*Spec.m`
or `*Spec.mm`.  You can add your own `autocmd` rules to if you use
a different naming convention.

Folding
-------

Folding is designed to make the Kiwi specs readable as specs at a glance,
hiding the backing code until you want to look at it.  In addition,
it still allows adding manual fold markers (e.g. {{{1 and }}}) so that
you can fold any supporting code in the file.
